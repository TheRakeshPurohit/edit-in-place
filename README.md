This is a utility plugin for Figma that lets you edit a master component in context. This only works for local components. This is great for when you have your master components organized on a different page, but can benefit from being able to make changes to it, in context. How it works:

1. Select an instance of the component you want to edit.
2. Run the plugin (cmd + / and then type 'Edit in place')
3. The instance will get hidden, and the master component added to your mockup
4. Click done when finished editing, and the instance will be unhidden and master component returned to its previous location

*IF YOU DO NOT CLICK 'DONE': the master component will be not be moved back to its previous location in the document*
