# Edit in place

This plugin enables you to select any instance of a local component (not from a library) and edit the master component in place from the context of wherever you are using the instance. This is handy if your master components are on another page!

###How it works
1. Select an instance of a local component 

2. Run 'Edit in place' (If you have selected a component from a library, the plugin will tell you).

3. The plugin will hide your instance and move your master in the context of your design so that you can edit it.

4. When you press done, or close the plugin UI, the instance will return and yout master component will remain at its previous location in the document.
